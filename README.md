Hey! I'm [Hyungtae Lim](https://limhyungtae.github.io/hyungtae-lim/), a robotics researcher who studies SLAM/perception/scene understanding. I achived my Ph.D at [KAIST](https://urobot.kaist.ac.kr/) in South Korea (advised by [Prof. Hyun Myung](https://urobot.kaist.ac.kr/url_teams/prof-hyunmyung/)), and recently wrapped up a postdoc at MIT (advised by Prof. [Luca Carlone](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/)), and just landed a job at a big tech company.

While preparing my industry applications, I quickly realized there's a huge discrepancy between what a big tech company needs and what academia expects. An academic CV is long, publication-heavy, and formatted for a human reviewer who cares about your research story. An industry resume needs to survive an ATS filter first — and a lot of the LaTeX tricks we use in academic CVs (custom fonts, multi-column layouts, fancy glyphs) silently break those parsers before a recruiter ever sees your name.

This repo collects the templates I used and adapted, organized by use case, so you don't have to figure that out the hard way.

## :bulb: The Core Insight: Project-Driven, Not Publication-Driven

The biggest mistake PhD students make when applying to industry is submitting a *publication-driven* CV. Here is the mindset shift:

| Academic CV | Industry Resume |
|---|---|
| "I published 10 papers at ICRA, RSS, RA-L…" | "I built X system that does Y, deployed on Z platforms" |
| Publications are the story | Projects are the story — publications are a one-line signal |
| Venue and novelty matter | Impact, scale, and real-world deployment matter |
| Readers are domain experts | First reader is an ATS parser, then a recruiter, then an engineer |

Another common mistake: **listing TA and academic service roles in Experience.** Industry hiring managers skip these — they are looking for engineering impact, not classroom administration. If you want to convey mentorship or leadership, fold it into a bullet under your main research role (e.g., *"Mentored 5+ graduate researchers, contributing to 4+ published papers"*).

**The "Selected Projects" section is the most important thing to customize.** For every application, ask: *which of my projects is most relevant to this specific team's work?* An AV perception team wants to see detection/segmentation work. A mapping team wants SLAM/HD map work. Swap your projects accordingly — do not send the same resume everywhere.

Open-source projects with GitHub stars are particularly powerful: they prove not just that you can build something, but that **others rely on your code** — which is exactly what production teams want to hire.

See [`GUIDELINES.md`](GUIDELINES.md) for the full CV→Resume conversion guide.

## :thinking: Which Template Should I Use?

> **Targeting industry (including big tech)?** Use `jakes-format/` first. Big tech companies (Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc.) route resumes through applicant tracking system (ATS) before a human ever reads them.
> Jake's format is plain pdfLaTeX with no custom fonts, no multi-column layout, and no special glyphs — all of which are common ATS failure points.
> If you prefer a denser, two-column layout and are confident the company accepts it, `deedy-format/` is a strong alternative.
>
> **Applying for a PhD program or academic position?** Use `research-cv/` — it supports multi-page layouts, full publication lists, and the detailed academic history that faculty committees expect.

| Template | Best For | Pages | Columns | Engine |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Awesome-CV** | Faculty/postdoc applications, academic CV | Multi-page | 1 | XeLaTeX |
| **Jake's** | Industry SWE/internship applications | 1 | 1 | pdfLaTeX |
| **Deedy** | Experienced tech professionals | 1 | 2 | XeLaTeX |
